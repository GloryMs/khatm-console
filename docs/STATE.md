# STATE — khatm-console

> Updated at the end of EVERY Claude Code session.

## Current phase / task

- Phase 1 — FS-C1/C1b feature screens — DONE (branches `feat/C1-feature-screens` and
  `feat/C1b-issue-screen`). Verify, Revoke, and Issue are wired; C1b PR #3 merged into `main`
  (2026-07-20, merge commit `d61416a`).

## Last completed

- 2026-07-20: FS-C1b Issue screen session. Confirmed C1 was merged into `main`, refreshed the
  vendored OpenAPI contract via `npm run contract:update` (authenticated `gh api` fallback), and
  regenerated types. The schema contract enrichment from khatm-platform PR #24
  (`KH-1.4.3 — allowed_schemas enforcement + schema contract enrichment`) is present:
  `SchemaSummary.code`, `SchemaDetail.code`, `sdFields`, `defaultMaxUses`, and `defaultValidity`.
  Delivered:
  - **Issue** (`/issue`, `RequireScope('issue')`): schema picker lists PUBLISHED schemas, displays
    localized `nameI18n` + `code` + version, loads schema detail, renders the C1 `IssueForm`, issues
    with `schemaCode` from the picked schema, then mints a one-time wallet claim code.
  - `IssueForm` now uses real `SchemaDetail.sdFields` for selective-disclosure badges instead of
    the C1 `required === false` workaround; `claims_def.required` remains the required-input rule.
  - `defaultMaxUses` and `defaultValidity` prefill the form; ISO-8601 day/hour/minute durations are
    parsed to display/submission minutes because the current generated `IssueRequest` still uses
    `validMinutes`.
  - Success view shows credential `ref`, one-time claim code, localized expiry plus relative
    countdown-style text, QR v1 via `qrPayload.ts` + `qrcode.react`, the `VITE_QR_API_BASE` value,
    and the localhost warning when applicable. The UI explicitly warns that the claim code is shown
    once and cannot be revealed again.
  - Sidebar now lists Issue as the first entry. EN/AR i18n parity is green.
  - Tests added/updated for real `sdFields`, default prefills, ISO duration parsing, schemaCode
    construction, issue→mint→QR byte-exact payload, localhost warning, and `/issue` scope gating.

- 2026-07-19: FS-C1 feature screens session. Refreshed the vendored contract twice: first pass
  had no claim-code endpoint at all (session paused, reported to Majd); the platform team merged
  `POST /api/v1/credentials/{id}/claim-code` (`ClaimCodeMintRequest/Response`) mid-session,
  second refresh picked it up. Delivered:
  - **Verify** (`/verify`, any authenticated operator): `VerifyPage` + `VerifyResult`, posts
    `{sdJwt}` to `/api/v1/credentials/verify`. Renders the optional KH-1.3 status-list fields
    (`statusListChecked/Version/Uri`) defensively — absent from the current contract, tolerated
    without crashing.
  - **Revoke** (`/revoke`, `RequireScope('revoke')`): `RevokePage` looks up a credential by
    **UUID `id`** (not `ref` — the contract's `{id}` path param is parsed as a UUID server-side,
    a brief/contract mismatch), shows `CredentialSummary`, and gates the destructive action
    behind `RevokeConfirmDialog` (type-the-id-to-confirm).
  - **Issue building blocks** (`src/features/issuance/`, unit-tested): `claimsDef.ts`,
    `qrPayload.ts`, and `IssueForm.tsx` were built but not wired until C1b.
  - Added `qrcode.react` (SVG mode, approved dependency), `.env.example`, and `vite-env.d.ts`
    support for `VITE_QR_API_BASE`.

## Environment facts

- Dev: web on :5173, Vite proxies `/api` and `/.well-known` to `localhost:8080`.
- Container: nginx on :3000→80, proxies `/api` and `/.well-known` to `http://khatm-api:8080`
  over the external `khatm-net` network.
- `khatm-platform` is a **private** repo — `npm run contract:update` falls back to `gh api`
  (works with the caller's own `gh` credentials). The contract, not platform source, is now
  sufficient for Issue request construction.
- Design tokens (`src/styles/tokens.css`) reuse the POC's neutral palette pending a real
  visual-identity file from the stakeholder.
- No browser-automation tool is available in this environment unless a future session gains one.
  For C1/C1b, automated checks cover type/lint/format/unit tests; a real manual visual/RTL pass
  should still happen before merge.

## Open decisions / blockers

- Revoke's lookup-by-id vs. the brief's lookup-by-`ref` is a brief/contract mismatch, not a gap —
  built to the contract (UUID `id`) per "path/type authority: the generated types, not this brief."
- Design tokens / visual identity file — pending from stakeholder (use neutral tokens meanwhile).
- `khatm-platform`'s CI publishing step for `docs/api/openapi.json` (KH-1.6) should eventually
  make the raw URL work without the `gh` fallback — worth revisiting once that lands.
- Dev-only `esbuild`/vitest-toolchain `npm audit` advisory (moderate, dev-server request forgery)
  — inherent to the current vitest 3.x → vite 6 chain, not a runtime/prod risk. No fix available
  without an unreleased vitest bump; revisit on next dependency update.

## Next up (ordered per Majd)

1. C2 / KH-1.1.1 schema management UI (create/version — still only a read-only list).
2. KH-1.1.4 credential search/list (feeds Revoke's know-the-id-up-front gap).
3. KH-1.1.3 bulk issuance: CSV upload → validate → preview → issue → report.
4. Dashboard v1 (issues/verifies/consumes/failures counters).
5. A real visual/RTL pass over Verify, Revoke, and Issue once a browser tool or the platform
   backend is available to click through against.
